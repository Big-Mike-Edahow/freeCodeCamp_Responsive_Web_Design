                    The Go programming language was developed at Google by in 2007 by
                    Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It was announced to
                    the public in November of 2009. Version 1.0 was released in March
                    of 2012.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Go is a statically typed and compiled high level language that aims
                    for simplicity. To quote Rob Pike: "Go's purpose is therefore not to
                    do research into programming language design; it is to improve the
                    working environment for its designers and their coworkers."
                </p>

                    <li>
                        One of Go's key aspects is it's speed as a compiled language. It's
                        standard library is optimized for performance and low resource usage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go's standard library contains the neccessary tools out of the box
                        to build http servers and communicate with database management systems.
                        Go has support for concurrency with goroutines and channels, garbage
                        collection and cloud development.

                <p>Before reading, you should have the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A working knowledge of high level programming languages. Concepts
                        such as variables, data types, and functions should be familiar to
                        you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Experience using a text-editor in an IDE (integrated development
                        environment). Visual Studio Code is a favorite choice for many
                        professional programmers. Code snippets will be given throughout.

                <p>The traditional first program written when learning a new programming
                    language is the quintessential "hello world", the origins of which can
                    be traced back to the early 1970's. Brian Kernighan (the author of "The
                    C Programming Language"), wrote the first version as part of a tutorial
                    for the B programming language while working at Bell Labs.</p>
                <code>
                    package main
                    import "fmt"

                    func main() {
	                    fmt.Println("Hello world!")
                    }
                </code>

            <article>
                <p>Go allows you to declare a variable the following ways:</p>
                <p>
                    Using the var keyword. An example: <code>var name string</code>
                    This declares a variable named <i>name</i>, of type <b>string</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A variable can be declared and initialized by assigning a value
                    to it. Code example: <code>var num int = 25</code> This declares a
                    variable named <i>num</i>, of type <b>integer</b>, and initializes
                    it to the value of 25.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the special := operator. The compiler will infer the variable's
                    data type by the value assigned to it. Example: <code>x := 13</code>
                    This declares a variable named <i>x</i> with an initial value of 13.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
            <header class="center">Function declarations</header><br>
            <article>
                <p>User defined functions in Go are declared using the <i>func</i> keyword,
                    the function name, parentheses, and curly brackets. This is also called
                    the function signature. An example function follows:
                    <code>
                    func squareRoot(num int) {
                        num = num * num
                        return num
                    }
                </code>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function <i>cannot</i> be a Go keyword.</li>
                    <li>
                        Function names should be short and concise. They should clearly
                        reflect the role that the function plays in the program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functions can be called in a program by using the function name
                        followed by parentheses. After the function is executed, program
                        flow will return to the point directly after the function call.
                    </li>
